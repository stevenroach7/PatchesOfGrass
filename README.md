# PatchesOfGrass

This is a project to benchmark algorithms that find the maximum area submatrix consisting of all 1's in a binary matrix.
We implement algorithms using two different approaches to this problem: Brute Force and Dynamic programming. Both algorithms were not
designed by us but are also not credited to anyone.
PatchOGrass contains our algorithms and methods to benchmark them.
The rest of the classes in the project are used for the visualization of the algorithms.

Note that the findMaxAreaSubmatrix methods in the Field class were tweaked to provide for a clearer visualization so are not identical to the
 corresponding methods in the PatchOGrass class but return the same results and have the same running time.

This program requires Java8, ACM.Jar, and the JUnit testing framework to run.
To run the visualizations, simply run the RunPatchOfGrass class. It is possible that the histogram label for the dynamic programming algorithm
will not be lined up correctly as we have found it lines up differently on Mac's vs. Pc's. To run our benchmarking of the algorithms, simply run the PatchOGrass class.
